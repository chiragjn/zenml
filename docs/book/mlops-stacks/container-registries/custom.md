## Base Abstraction

In the current version of ZenML, container registries have a rather basic base 
abstraction. In essence, each container registry features a `uri` as an 
instance configuration and a non-abstract `prepare_image_push` method for 
validation.

```python
from typing import ClassVar

from zenml.enums import StackComponentType
from zenml.stack import StackComponent
from zenml.utils import docker_utils


class BaseContainerRegistry(StackComponent):
    """Base class for all ZenML container registries."""
    
    # Instance configuration
    uri: str

    # Class variables
    TYPE: ClassVar[StackComponentType] = StackComponentType.CONTAINER_REGISTRY

    def prepare_image_push(self, image_name: str) -> None:
        """Conduct necessary checks/preparations before an image gets pushed."""

    def push_image(self, image_name: str) -> None:
        """Pushes a docker image."""
        if not image_name.startswith(self.uri):
            raise ValueError(
                f"Docker image `{image_name}` does not belong to container "
                f"registry `{self.uri}`."
            )

        self.prepare_image_push(image_name)
        docker_utils.push_docker_image(image_name)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a slimmed-down version of the base implementation which aims to 
highlight the abstraction layer. In order to see the full implementation 
and get the complete docstrings, please check the [API docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/api_docs/container_registries/#zenml.container_registries.base_container_registry.BaseContainerRegistry).

## Building your own container registry

If you want to create your own custom flavor for a container registry, you can 
follow the following steps:

1. Create a class which inherits from the `BaseContainerRegistry`.
2. Define the `FLAVOR` class variable.
3. If you need to execute any checks/validation before the image gets pushed, 
you can define these operations in the `prepare_image_push` method. As an 
example, you can check the `AWSContainerRegistry`.
4. Once the `prepare_image_push` gets completed, the `push_image` method will 
come into play and utilize a `DockerClient` object to push the image.

Once you are done with the implementation, you can register it through the CLI 
as:

```shell
zenml container-registry flavor register <THE-SOURCE-PATH-OF-YOUR-REGISTRY>
```
