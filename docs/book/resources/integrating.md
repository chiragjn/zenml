# External Integration Guide

![ZenML integrates with a bunch of tools from the MLOps landscape](../assets/sam-side-by-side-full-text.png)

One of the main goals of ZenML is to find some semblance of order in the ever-growing MLOps landscape. ZenML already provides [numerous integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) into many popular tools, and allows you to [extend ZenML](../developer-guide/advanced-usage/custom-flavors.md) in order to fill in any gaps that are remaining.

However, what if you want to make your extension of ZenML part of the main codebase, to share it with others? If you are such a person, e.g., a tooling provider in the ML/MLOps space, or just want to contribute a tooling integration to ZenML, this guide is intended for you.

## Step 1: Categorize your integration

In [Extending ZenML](../developer-guide/advanced-usage/custom-flavors.md), we already looked at the categories and abstractions that core ZenML defines. In order to create a new integration into ZenML, you would need to first find the categories that your integration belongs to. The list of categories can be found on [this page](../mlops-stacks/categories.md).

Note that one integration may belong to different categories: For example, the cloud integrations (AWS/GCP/Azure) contain [container registries](../mlops-stacks/container-registries/container-registries.md), [artifact stores](../mlops-stacks/artifact-stores/artifact-stores.md), [metadata stores](../mlops-stacks/metadata-stores/metadata-stores.md), etc.

## Step 2: Create individual stack components

Each category selected above would correspond to a [stack component](../developer-guide/stacks-profiles-repositories/stack.md#stack-components). You can now start developing these individual stack components by following the detailed instructions on each stack component page.

Before you package your new components into an integration, you may want to first register them with the `zenml <STACK_COMPONENT> flavor register` command and use/test them as a regular custom flavor. E.g., when [developing an orchestrator](../mlops-stacks/orchestrators/custom.md) you can use:

```
zenml orchestrator flavor register <THE-SOURCE-PATH-OF-YOUR-ORCHESTRATOR>
```

See the docs on extensibility of the different components [here ](../developer-guide/advanced-usage/custom-flavors.md) or get inspired by the many integrations that are already implemented, for example the mlflow [experiment tracker](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/mlflow/experiment\_trackers/mlflow\_experiment\_tracker.py).

## Step 3: Integrate into the ZenML repo

You can now start the process of including your integration into the base ZenML package. Follow this checklist to prepare everything:

### Clone Repo

Once your stack components work as a custom flavor, you can now [clone the main zenml repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) and follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to set up your local environment for develop.

### **Create the integration directory**

All integrations live within [`src/zenml/integrations/`](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/src/zenml/integrations) in their own subfolder. You should create a new folder in this directory with the name of your integration.

### Define the name of your integration in constants

In [`zenml/integrations/constants.py`](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/constants.py), add:

```python
EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION = "<name-of-integration>"
```

This will be the name of the integration when you run:

```shell
 zenml integration install <name-of-integration>
```

Or when you specify pipeline requirements:

```python
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline
from zenml.integrations.constants import <EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION>

@pipeline(required_integrations=[<EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION>])
def custom_pipeline():
    ...
```

### Create the integration class \_\_init\_\_.py

In `src/zenml/integrations/<YOUR_INTEGRATION>/`\_\_`init__.py` you must now create an new class, which is a subclass of the `Integration` class, set some important attributes (`NAME` and `REQUIREMENTS`), and overwrite the `flavors` class method.

```python
from typing import List

from zenml.enums import StackComponentType
from zenml.integrations.constants import <EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION>
from zenml.integrations.integration import Integration
from zenml.zen_stores.models import FlavorWrapper

# This is the flavor that will be used when registering this stack component
#  `zenml <type-of-stack-component> register ... -f example-orchestrator-flavor`
EXAMPLE_ORCHESTRATOR_FLAVOR = <"example-orchestrator-flavor">

# Create a Subclass of the Integration Class
class ExampleIntegration(Integration):
    """Definition of Example Integration for ZenML."""

    NAME = <EXAMPLE_INTEGRATION>
    REQUIREMENTS = ["<INSERT PYTHON REQUIREMENTS HERE>"]

    @classmethod
    def flavors(cls) -> List[FlavorWrapper]:
        """Declare the stack component flavors for the <EXAMPLE> integration."""
        return [
            # Create a FlavorWrapper for each Stack Component this Integration implements
            FlavorWrapper(
                name=EXAMPLE_ORCHESTRATOR_FLAVOR,    
                source="<path.to.the.implementation.of.the.component",      # Give the source of the component implementation
                type=StackComponentType.<TYPE-OF-STACK-COMPONENT>,      # Define which component is implemented
                integration=cls.NAME,
            )
        ]

ExampleIntegration.check_installation() # this checks if the requirements are installed
```

Have a look at the [MLflow Integration](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/mlflow/\_\_init\_\_.py) as an example for how it is done.

### Copy your implementation(s)

As said above, each Integration can have implementations for multiple ZenML stack components. Generally the outer repository structure `src/zenml/<stack-component>/<base-component-impl.py` is reflected inside the integration folder: `integrations/<name-of-integration>/<stack-component>/<custom-component-impl.py`

Here, you can now copy the code you created in [Step 2](./integrating.md#step-2-create-individual-stack-components) above.&#x20;

### Import in all the right places

The Integration itself must be imported within [`src/zenml/integrations/__init__.py`](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/\_\_init\_\_.py)`.`

The Implementation of the individual stack components also needs to be imported within the sub-modules: `src/zenml/integrations/<name-of-integration>/<specifc-component>/__init__.py.`For example, in the mlflow integration, the [experiment tracker](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/mlflow/experiment\_trackers/\_\_init\_\_.py) and [deployer](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/mlflow/model\_deployers/\_\_init\_\_.py) are imported in the sub-module `__init__.py` files.

## Step 4: Create a PR and celebrate :tada:

You can now [create a PR](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare) to ZenML and wait for the core maintainers to take a look. Thank you so much for your contribution to the code-base, rock on!
