description: All possible ways for our community to get in touch with ZenML.
---

The ZenML team and community have put together a list of references
that can be used to get in touch with the development team of ZenML and 
develop a deeper understanding about the framework.

## Slack Channel: Get help from the community 

The ZenML [Slack Channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite) is the main gathering 
point for the community. Not only is it the best place to get in touch with the 
core team of ZenML, it is also a great way to discuss new ideas and share 
your own ZenML projects with the community. If you have a question, there is 
a high chance someone else might have already answered it on Slack!

## YouTube Channel: Video tutorials 

Our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi79n61eV2sVyYxJOqk\_bMw) 
features a growing set of videos that take you through the entire framework. 
Go here if you are a visual learner, and follow along with some tutorials.

## Public Roadmap

The feedback from our community plays a significant role in the development
of ZenML. That's why we have a [Public Roadmap](https://zenml.hellonext.co/roadmap) 
that serves as a bridge between our users and our development team. If you 
have any new ideas regarding any new features or want to prioritize on above 
the other, feel free to share you thoughts here or vote on existing ideas.

## Blog

In our [Blog](https://blog.zenml.io/) page, you can find various articles written by our team. We use 
it as a platform to share our thoughts and explain the implementation process 
of our tool, its new features and the thought process behind them.

## Podcast

We also have a [Podcast](https://podcast.zenml.io/) series brings you 
interviews and discussion with industry leaders, top technology professionals 
and others. We discuss the latest developments in machine learning, deep 
learning, artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on MLOps, or how 
trained models are used in production.

## Newsletter

You can also subscribe to our [Newsletter](https://zenml.substack.com/) where
we share what we learn as we develop open-source tooling for production 
machine learning. You will also get all the exciting news about ZenML in 
general.

## Community Event

Every week, as a [ZenML community event](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/zenml-meet-the-community-tickets-354426688767), 
our core team pops in a session for 30 minutes to interact directly with the 
community. Sometimes we'll be presenting a feature, other times just taking 
questions and having fun. Join us if you are curious about ZenML or just want 
to talk shop about MLOps.
